    <h1>Who is Bradley Pawlow?</h1>
    <div class="box">

      <p>I am currently a student at Northwestern University pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Data Science. Recently, 
        I have developed a keen curiosity for the increasing advancement of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised 
        learning methods, and its substantial effects on our everyday life. For example, I discovered not too long ago that machine 
        learning was utilized to predict fantasy football points each week for each NFL player. Who would have thought such a popular 
        phenomenon can easily be transformed from artificial intelligence? Trivial findings like these inspire me to discover new ideas 
        and concepts whenever I can, whether related to technology or not, because I firmly believe that <b>knowledge</b> holds the key to vastly 
        improving society and helping others.</p>

      <p>Aside from my growing interest in the technology field, I enjoy expanding my interests outside 
        the realm of education. Believe it or not, I am not glued to my laptop 24/7.</p>
        <p><i>If you want to learn more about the coding projects I have designed or have been working on,

    <h2>Baseball</h2>

      <div class="box">

        <p>I am a baseball fanatic. I grew up playing and watching baseball from a young age, 
          partly because my father and grandfather are also huge baseball fans and encouraged me 
          to get into it. However, it took a while for my love of the game to fully sink in. 
          My first ever T-Ball game I decided it would be enjoyable, and I guess somehow 
          appropriate, to distract myself from the game and either pick the grass or 
          lay down in the outfield.</p>
  
      </div>

      <div class="box">

      <p>Nevertheless, I did end up maturing enough to appreciate the game and next thing I knew 
        I played baseball throughout high school and still play now in college, 
        in addition to teaching and mentoring younger baseball players.</p>

      <h3>My Passion For Other Sports</h3>
      
      <div class="box">

      <p>In addition to baseball, I also keep myself active by playing other recreational sports 
        such as football, basketball,
         and even the trending sport <a id="link-to-spikeball" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundnet>
          Spikeball</a>.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="box">

          <p>I am always excited when the NFL season comes around not only because I can 
            inally watch the Chicago Bears play, 
            but because it is a new year and opportunity to win my fantasy football league. 
            I take fantasy football seriously considering I was once a back-to-back 
            champion back in 2014 and 2015. Yeah, I know. Last few years have been pretty rough 
            for me in terms of winning. </p>

          <h4>Traveling</h4>

          <div class="box">

            <p>I also enjoy traveling and leaving my comfort zone to explore other states and 
              even other parts of the world. I find that taking a break from some of the 
              monotonous aspects of my daily life is therapeutic, especially when I willing to 
              surround myself with new surroundings and learn more about 
              other parts of the world.</p>

              <p>The above photos were taken when I visited Costa Rica in 2017. 
                It was interesting to witness the change in culture and the abundance of welcoming, 
                friendly natives. It was also refreshing to explore the nature in Costa Rica, 
                including the various plant and animal species that you would not 
                encounter in the United States. </p>
